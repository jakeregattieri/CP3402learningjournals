## Content Insights

Using LinkedIn Learning resources, this week began with learning Joomla's Categories and Articles. Creating categories established a logical hierarchy for the website content. I started injecting content into the site through articles. I learned that where articles initially appear on the site is not as important as just getting the content onto the site to be reorganized later on as I learn to structure the site. I learned how to format text, input images, and create external linksâ€”tools I know will be useful in the future to enrich the content. Following this, I moved into menu management, learning how to create and manage menus and items. I feel I now have a pretty good idea of how I want the site to navigate and have begun structuring menus on the site.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Joomla represents a strategic advantage in today's digital landscape, offering an advanced skill set that goes beyond mere web development fundamentals. CMS platforms stand at the core of contemporary web creation and management, empowering developers to craft, tailor, and upkeep intricate websites with unparalleled efficiency and adaptability. Achieving proficiency in CMS platforms bestows on professionals the competence to manage varied content types, organize information coherently, and optimize user experiences effectively. Delving into Joomla, akin to acquiring a new language in the realm of technology, opens up a realm of possibilities.
