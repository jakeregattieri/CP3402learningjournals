## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 6 hours this week on learning activities. This includes:
- 2 hours watching and applying insights from the LinkedIn Learning course on WordPress themes.
- 4 hours experimenting with different themes and customizations on my WordPress site.

## Content Insights

Transitioning my startup's website, Obsidian Keys Conservatory, from Joomla to WordPress initially seemed daunting due to my unfamiliarity with the differences between the two CMS platforms. This shift, however, not only enabled me to replicate the basic structure of my Joomla site but also opened up new avenues for customization and design refinement that were previously unexplored. Creating essential pages like Home, About Obsidian Keys Conservatory, Coaching Services, and Meet The Coaches in WordPress turned out to be a straightforward process, very much akin to working with Joomla's articles, which eased some of my initial apprehensions.

The exploration of various templates within WordPress was initially overwhelming, given the sheer volume of options available. This vast selection made it challenging to narrow down the choices, but it also highlighted the platform's flexibility and the potential for customization. I eventually gravitated towards the Astra template, as recommended by the LinkedIn Learning course I was following. This choice, while still open to future changes, provided a solid foundation for understanding WordPress's capabilities and for beginning the customization process.

Dabbling in the advanced CSS settings was an experiment aimed at getting a hands-on understanding of how WordPress allows for deeper customization. By adjusting the title fonts and colors, I was able to personalize the site's appearance significantly though i did not keep any of these changes for now. 



## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Focusing on the technical aspects of WordPress and theme management this week has underscored the importance of continuous learning and adaptability in the tech field. The ability to quickly learn and apply new skills, such as selecting and customizing a WordPress theme, is crucial for staying relevant and competitive in the job market. 

This experience has also highlighted the value of self-directed learning through online courses and tutorials. Such resources are invaluable for keeping up with emerging trends and technologies, reinforcing the idea that being proactive in your education is key to career development in technology and digital media.

Despite the setback of not participating in the group formation due to illness, this week was productive in terms of gaining practical skills in WordPress site development. The insights gained from the LinkedIn Learning course have equipped me with the knowledge to make more informed decisions regarding theme selection and site design, contributing to my overall growth as a web developer.
