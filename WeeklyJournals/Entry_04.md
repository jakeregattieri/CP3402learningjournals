This week delving into local WordPress development. I chose VCCW, attracted by its WordPress-centric design. However, I ran into outdated components and compatibility issues, which significantly hindered my progress. This was a crucial lesson for me about the importance of not only having a WordPress-focused environment but also ensuring that the tools and components I rely on are up-to-date and compatible with my development needs.

Faced with these challenges, I decided to pivot to Scotch Box, known for its simplicity in setup. I was drawn to it, hoping for a smoother development experience. Scotch Box proved to be user-friendly at first, offering an easier setup process that seemed like a promising solution to the obstacles I had encountered with VCCW. However, this transition brought its own set of challenges. I soon discovered complexities related to package management and system updates within Scotch Box. These new hurdles illuminated the nuanced nature of maintaining a development environment that can keep pace with current technologies.

this experance emphasized the trade-offs between ease of use and the complexities of keeping a development environment up-to-date with the latest technological advancements.



## Career/Employability/Learning Insights


Learning insights this week were highlighted by my decision to shift to Docker, chosen for its capability to create consistent and isolated environments. Docker's containerization technology efficiently packages applications, ensuring uniformity across environments and easing deployment challenges. This move is anticipated to be particularly beneficial for future group projects, where coworkers may access the projects from various machines. This transition underscores the importance of adaptability and openness to exploring new tools in technology, enhancing not only my technical skills but also deepening my grasp of project management and strategic decision making in software development.
