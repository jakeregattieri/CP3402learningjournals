## Estimated Hours

5 hours

# Experiment Overview

**Objective:** To determine if the Reflective Spaced Pomodoro method enhances learning efficiency and retention more than traditional, uninterrupted study sessions over a similar total study time.

## Hypothesis

The Reflective Spaced Pomodoro method will lead to better retention, understanding, and engagement with the material than a traditional, uninterrupted 2-hour study session.

## Procedure

### Day 1: Reflective Spaced Pomodoro Method

1. **Preparation:** Select and organize the instructional content into four 25-minute segments that can be covered throughout the day.
2. **Study Sessions:** Allocate four 25-minute sessions throughout the day for focused study.
   - **Reflection:** Before each session, spend 5 minutes reflecting on what was learned in the previous session to prepare for the next segment.
3. **Self-Assessment:** After completing all sessions complete self-assessment quiz.

### Day 2: Traditional Study Session

1. **Preparation:** Use the same instructional content to ensure content consistency across both methods.
2. **Study Session:** Study for 2 continuous hours, trying to cover the material in a single session without designated breaks for focused study.
3. **Self-Assessment:** complete self-assessment quiz.

## Evaluation

After each study method is completed, take a short break, then complete the same test or quiz to evaluate your retention and understanding of the material.

## Self-Assessment Questions

1. How focused did you feel during the study session? (Scale: 1-10, where 1 is completely distracted and 10 is highly focused)
2. How fatigued did you feel by the end of the study session? (Scale: 1-10, where 1 is not fatigued at all and 10 is extremely fatigued)
3. How engaged did you feel with the material? (Scale: 1-10, where 1 is not engaged at all and 10 is highly engaged)
4. How well do you feel you absorbed the material? (Scale: 1-10, where 1 is not absorbed at all and 10 is fully absorbed)
5. Rate your overall satisfaction with the study session. (Scale: 1-10, where 1 is completely dissatisfied and 10 is highly satisfied)

## Reflective Spaced Pomodoro Method

- **Quiz/Test Score:** 90%
- **Focus:** 8.5/10.
- **Fatigue:** 2/10.
- **Engagement:** 9/10.
- **Material Absorption:** 9/10
- **Overall Satisfaction:** 9/10.

## Traditional Study Session

- **Quiz/Test Score:** 70%
- **Focus:** 6/10.
- **Fatigue:** 7/10.
- **Engagement:** 5/10.
- **Overall Satisfaction:** 5/10, 
- **Material Absorption:** 6/10

## Conclusion

The Reflective Spaced Pomodoro method, with its structured breaks and reflective periods, appears to enhance learning efficiency, retention, and engagement compared to traditional, continuous study sessions. The spaced approach reduces cognitive fatigue, allowing for sustained focus and engagement, while the reflective periods before each session help in consolidating previous knowledge.

## Reflection

This experiment suggests that breaking up study sessions and incorporating reflective practice not only makes the learning experience more enjoyable but also more effective. Reflecting on learning strategies and outcomes could be a valuable addition to personal study routines, potentially leading to improved academic performance and deeper understanding of material. If I had to do this experiment again, I would increase the amount of time each study method was evaluated and introduce additional variables beyond a self-evaluation quiz to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their impacts.
