This week was focused on establishing assignment 2’s team collaborative framework. Our primary goal was to set up essential teamwork tools, integrate and lay the foundation of our group agreement. Here’s a brief overview of how we tackled these tasks:

Tool Integration and Setup
Discord: Our team decided to use Discord as our primary communication tool, which was chosen for real-time discussions and meetings.
GitHub Repo: Setting up the GitHub repository was straightforward. we created the repo, ensuring the name matched our Slack group and Discord to maintain consistency. The repo acts as the central hub for our version control, hosting our project's codebase and documentation.

Trello Board/GitHub Project: We opted for Trello for project management, appreciating its visual appeal and ease of use. we organized our project's milestones and tasks into various lists and cards on our Trello board, making sure to reflect our project's scope and objectives accurately.

GitHub Commit and Group Agreement
Commit: My first GitHub commit involved adding my name to the README file which marked the beginning of our development workflow and collaborative work.
Group Agreement: Finalizing our group agreement was a collective effort. During the practical we discussed each member's expectations, skills, and how handle conflicts. This agreement is made part of our Trello board which serves as a guide for out interactions and responsibilities.
